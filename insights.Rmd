First, we need to use tidyverse lib for data import and manipulation.

```{r}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library("tidyverse")

survey <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/introdsci/MusicSurvey/master/music-survey.csv")
preferences <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/introdsci/MusicSurvey/master/preferences-survey.csv")


```
Cleaning dataframes column names:
```{r}
colnames(survey)[colnames(survey) == "What is your pseudonym?"] <- "pseudonym"
colnames(survey)[colnames(survey) == "Year you were born (YYYY)"] <- "birth_year"
```
